<p>This Ontario Makers and Mentors Innovation Conference is a student initiative supported by the University of Ottawa Faculty of Engineering and Centre Engineering Entrepreneurial Design. In collaboration with the Richard L’abbe uOttawa Makerspace and our sponsors we create a conference where makers, entrepreneurs, hobbyists and students can come out to compete in innovative design, meet companies from the industry and see the latest and greatest in project technology. While our mentors will be able to also enjoy everything listed above, there will be special workshops and speakers designed to educate teachers on the project resources, how they can be incorporated in project based learning and how teachers can form their own makerspaces.

  <h1>The 2017 Conference
  </h1>
</center>

<p>

 The 2016 Ontario Makers and Mentors Conference is themed “Building Ideas”. The innovation that fuels our makers and mentors comes from an idea. In the 2016 conference we will build these ideas and foster innovation. Everyone leaving this year’s conference will be inspired to go back into their schools and communities and bring their imagination to life, start their own makerspaces and use new technology to bring their ideas to life.
</p>
  <h2>Ontario Makers and Mentors Conference 2016</h2>
<h3>  BUILDING IDEAS</h3>
<p>

 Our committee has gathered speakers; planned workshops, sessions and demonstrations to provide makers with resources and the latest of new technology and to help teachers learn about tinkering and how to incorporate it into the classroom. Held in the nations’ capital, the 2016 conference will bring together our maker and mentor communities in a way that hasn’t been done before.
