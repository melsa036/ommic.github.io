              <p>Lethania Martinez, is an Engineering Master’s  student (EMP) at uOttawa. She has over 13 years experience in the operations and data analysis fields.
<br />The interest in electronics came from participating in one of the Entrepreneurship Programs at the Faculty of Engineering in 2015, since then, Lethania has been attending workshops and developing prototypes in order to increase her knowledge in Programming and Robotics. While working in one of her projects, she noted that young kids were able to grasp some of the concepts of programmings by “doing”, and they were engage by the entrepreneurial concept of solving problems. Lethania has been delivering short Robotics ( EV3/Arduino mBlock ) workshops for free to dedicated young students that show interest in learning robotics, and that are willing to master concepts to be able to pass the knowledge on the newer members of the team. The 2017 Fall session will start  in November with the support of a local school in Ottawa West ( EV3/Arduino mBlock Workshop will continue to run free of charge for dedicated students)
